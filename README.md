Service Hours Tracker
=

Flask based python web application for tracking service hours, developed for the Center for Civicengagement at Westminster College.

My code is public domain, but the third party libraries I use of course fall under their own license and the westminster logo is copyright westminster college. Branding / use of the name westminster college or the service learning scholars program name is also under trademark.
